<p>j.2C usually requires something covering it (such as a Graviton or a trap) or Kokonoe must spend meter in order to convert it into a full combo. However, in the instances shown below, Kokonoe can combo off j.2C without help since she'll be able to link j.2C into 5A:
</p>
<ul><li>When Kokonoe lands j.2C as an air to air with the opponent slightly higher than her</li>
<li>When Kokonoe lands a Fatal Counter TK j.2C</li></ul>
<p>When performing any route involving 236D &gt; 22B &gt; 2C / 236[A], <b>be sure to hold D from 236D and release as late as you can</b> (which usually is only for a split second or so, but it'll depend on the hitstun of the move used beforehand. Try to aim for as late into that as possible.) (This will often be notated as "236[D]~]D[", though this applies regardless of how its noted). This is required in many instances of the route, to have enough time to link 22B &gt; 2C / 236A, or even for instances it's not required will still make the link far more lenient.
</p><p>You're also going to want to learn combos that involve using no Gravitons at all in case you're put into a situation where you don't have any remaining or you don't have enough for a specific combo. Additionally, these 'Gravitonless' combos are better when they are longer since they will give you more time to regenerate any missing Gravitons.
