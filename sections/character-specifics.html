    The 3C(1) in air hit 6B &gt; 5C &gt; 3C(1) must be delayed on the following characters in order to prevent combos from dropping both when midscreen and in the corner: <b>Hazama</b>, <b>Mu</b>, <b>Tager</b>, <b>Terumi</b>, <b>Tsubaki</b>, and <b>Valkenhayn</b>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Hakumen</b> and <b>Makoto</b> require that 3C(1) is delayed when they're in the corner, though it is not required when they're midscreen.

<p>
    Routes involving 5D &gt; 5B &gt; 5C &gt; 236[A]~D will not work on <b>Taokaka</b>, <b>Carl</b>, <b>Relius</b>, <b>Izayoi</b>, <b>Amane</b>, <b>Es</b>, <b>Bullet</b>, and <b>Platinum</b>, due to their hurtbox being <i>just</i> far enough forward to where the activate whiffs. On long starters, this can be remedied by going straight into 5B &gt; 236[A]~D, but be sure to confirm it quickly
</p>
<p>
    Most routes involving 6B &gt; 5C &gt; 3C(1) &gt; 22A will not work on <b>Carl</b>, <b>Tsubaki</b>, <b>Hazama</b>, <b>Mu</b>, <b>Makoto</b>, <b>Valkenhein</b>, <b>Kokonoe</b>, <b>Terumi</b>, <b>Celica</b>, <b>Hibiki</b>, <b>Susan</b>, and <b>Mai</b>, as they dont get popped far enough back for the lightning to hit.

    Converting without setup after a TK (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Tiger%20Knee">Tiger Knee</a>) j.2C using j.2C &gt; j.5D &gt; j.A(1) &gt; 236D isn't possible on <b>Ragna</b>, <b>Makoto</b>, <b>Amane</b>, and <b>Es</b>. Against <b>Noel</b>, <b>Nu</b>, <b>Tsubaki</b>, <b>Hazama</b>, <b>Kagura</b>, <b>Terumi</b>, and <b>Lamda</b>, it will only work in corner.
